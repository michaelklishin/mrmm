# Multi-repository Milestone Manager

This is a tiny CLI tool that helps manage milestones in multiple GitHub
repositories.

Consider a project which is produced from multiple repositories. When a release
is published, an existing milestone has to be closed and a new one has to be created
in all of the repos. This tool makes it easier for both humans and machines/pipelines.

The tool is very immature and currently has zero documentation.

In its current state it's almost certainly isn't suitable for anyone but the author.
